    informalVersion: 'You have to sit here.',
    formalVersion: 'Could you please take your seat here? This is your assigned seat for today\'s flight.',
    explanation:
      '"You have to" sounds like a command and can feel rude. "Could you please" is a polite request that achieves the same result while respecting the passenger\'s dignity.',
    keyPrinciple: 'Use requests rather than commands',

    formalVersion: 'I\'m sorry, the chicken option is no longer available. May I offer you the pasta instead? It\'s equally popular.',
    explanation:
      'Blunt refusal without an alternative leaves the passenger with nothing. A professional response acknowledges the limitation and immediately offers a solution.',

    formalVersion: 'I\'m sorry to interrupt — I just need to ask you to switch your device to airplane mode as we are preparing for takeoff. Thank you so much.',
    explanation:
      'Starting with an apology for interrupting softens the request. "Just" makes the request sound minor and reasonable. Thanking in advance assumes compliance respectfully.',

    formalVersion: 'Thank you so much for your patience — I\'ll be with you in just a moment.',
    explanation:
      '"Wait a minute, I\'m busy" sounds dismissive and rude. Thanking the passenger for patience, even before they have shown it, is a powerful psychological technique that creates warmth.',
    keyPrinciple: 'Acknowledge before you redirect',

    formalVersion: 'I\'m afraid that\'s not something I\'m able to accommodate today, but let me see what I can do to help you instead.',
    explanation:
      'A flat "no" creates a dead end. "I\'m afraid" softens the refusal. Offering to find an alternative shows genuine intent to help despite the limitation.',
    keyPrinciple: 'Never end on "no" — always offer a direction forward',

    formalVersion: 'I completely understand your frustration, and I genuinely want to help resolve this. Could you tell me a little more about what happened so I can find the best solution for you?',
    explanation:
      '"Calm down" is one of the worst things you can say to an upset person — it is invalidating and often escalates anger. Acknowledging the frustration and demonstrating genuine intent to help is far more effective.',
    keyPrinciple: 'Validate emotions before offering solutions',

    formalVersion: 'Good morning. Is there anything I can help you with, or anything that would make your flight more comfortable today?',
    explanation:
      'An open-ended "do you need anything?" can feel routine. A warmer, more specific offer ("anything to make your flight more comfortable") feels more personal and more likely to elicit a response.',
    keyPrinciple: 'Make proactive offers feel personal and specific',

    explanation:
      'Explaining the reason (safety) transforms a rule into something understandable. "Would you mind" is a polite request form. Always give context rather than just citing "rules."',
    keyPrinciple: 'Explain the why behind rules to increase compliance',

    formalVersion: 'I\'d just like to help you find the right seat — may I take a look at your boarding pass? It looks like you might be in a slightly different row.',
    explanation:
      'Being corrected feels embarrassing. Framing it as "helping you find the right seat" rather than "you\'re wrong" reduces embarrassment and creates a collaborative tone. "Might be" is softer than "you are."',
    keyPrinciple: 'Frame corrections as help, not accusation',
    alternativeVersions: [
      'Let me help you check your seat number — there may have been a small mix-up.',

    formalVersion: 'I want to make sure you receive the very best assistance — let me bring our senior crew member over to help you. I\'ll be back with you in just a moment.',
    explanation:
      'Saying "I can\'t help you anymore" sounds like abandonment. Framing the escalation as ensuring the passenger gets the best possible help maintains positive intent while appropriately escalating.',
    keyPrinciple: 'Escalation should sound like an upgrade, not a rejection',
    alternativeVersions: [

    formalVersion: 'I\'m genuinely sorry to hear this has been your experience — that is not the standard we aim for, and I want to do everything I can to make this right.',
    explanation:
      '"I\'m sorry you feel that way" is widely recognized as a non-apology that invalidates the person\'s experience. A genuine apology acknowledges the experience, takes ownership, and commits to improvement.',
    keyPrinciple: 'Genuine apologies take ownership — not just acknowledge feelings',
    alternativeVersions: [
      'I sincerely apologize for this — that is not the experience we want for you.',

What I can do is make a PA announcement requesting that passengers in your immediate area refrain from consuming nuts, ensure you\'re aware of exactly what is in our catering today, and keep the medical kit close. Please let me know immediately if you feel any reaction at all.',

    options: ['eat', 'consume', 'dine on'],
