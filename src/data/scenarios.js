    explanation:
      'Option B demonstrates the key cabin crew qualities: empathy, problem-solving, and taking personal ownership rather than deflecting. Acknowledging inconvenience with a small additional gesture (a snack, extra beverage, or a priority meal next flight if possible) transforms a negative experience into evidence that the crew genuinely cares. Simply informing the passenger that nothing can be done (A) provides no resolution and escalates frustration. Waiting to check (C) delays unnecessarily when the immediate action is clear.

    explanation: 'During approach and landing, a standing passenger is a severe safety risk — to themselves and others in the event of a go-around or hard landing. This is the situation where cabin crew use their absolute authority. "Sir/Ma\'am, you MUST be seated right now. This is a safety requirement and I cannot allow you to remain standing." Physical force is never appropriate unless facing an extreme safety threat requiring restraint per training.',

    bestAnswer: 'B',
    explanation: 'Accessibility and mental health needs deserve genuine accommodation. If an aisle seat is available, there is no reason not to move the passenger. Checking takes 60 seconds and could make the entire flight manageable for someone with claustrophobia. The response should be warm and immediate, not procedural.',
